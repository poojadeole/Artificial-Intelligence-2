Developed a game-‘Gang Wars’ using Alpha-Beta Pruning and Minimax Algorithm. The board will be a n*n matrix. Each gang has to acquire maximum squares given a certain set of rules. The gang with maximum score wins.

The rules of the game are as follows:

1. Two players play this game.

2. Each player takes turns as in tic-tac-toe.

3. Each square has points between 1 to 99.

4. The object of the game for each player is to score most points, where the score is the sum of all the points on the sqaures conquered by the player minus the sum of all the sqaure points acquired by the opponent.

5.The game ends when all the squares are acquired and no more sqaures are remaining.
